# *JARVIS*

A generative AI-driven CLI for testing

Jarvis is a powerful CLI tool that leverages advanced generative AI technologies (such as Google's Gemini Pro LLM and Gemini Vision Pro) to streamline and enhance various software testing activities. It aims to revolutionize how we approach test case generation and scenario creation.

## Features:

* **Effortless Test Scenario Generation**: Analyze provided API specs (OpenAPI v3.0 and potentially others) to automatically suggest comprehensive test scenarios, covering both positive and negative test cases.
* **AI-Driven Test Case Writing**: Leverages the language model's capabilities to draft detailed test cases, ensuring clarity, accuracy, and consistency.
* **Image/Document Analysis**: (Powered by Gemini Vision Pro) Extends analysis to screenshots, wireframes, or other visual representations of expected behavior, enhancing scenario generation and test case creation.
