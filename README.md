# jarvis Test Automation Assistant

A powerful CLI tool powered by Google's Gemini Pro LLM and Gemini Vision Pro to revolutionize software testing. Jarvis aims to streamline test scenario generation and testcase writing directly from API specifications or protocol buffer definitions.

## Features:

* Effortless Test Scenario Generation: Analyze provided API specs (OpenAPI v3.0 and potentially others) to automatically suggest comprehensive test scenarios, covering both positive and negative test cases.
* AI-Driven Test Case Writing: Leverages the language model's capabilities to draft detailed test cases, ensuring clarity, accuracy, and consistency.
* Image/Document Analysis: (Powered by Gemini Vision Pro) Extends analysis to screenshots, wireframes, or other visual representations of expected behavior, enhancing scenario generation and test case creation.
